# Current Priorities

## DONE: P0: Full Autonomy (Founding Directive)

Brain upgraded to full autonomous cycle: health check, data freshness, context-aware planning, self-reporting to `.context/state/health.json`. Completed 2025-02-06.

## DONE: P1: Clarity

Dead npm scripts fixed. Redundant operatives (supervisor, run-operative, live-server) deleted. express/cors deps removed. Empty cron dir removed. Brain is the single canonical process. Completed 2025-02-06.

## P0: Automated Data Collection

Move COLLECT from manual to automated. Vercel cron or equivalent for 6-hour sync cycles.

## P1: Complete MP Profiles

Finish quote extraction for remaining 49/101 MPs to achieve full ANALYZE coverage.

## P2: Honest Accuracy

Always measure and report post-cutoff prediction accuracy. Current true accuracy: 73.3%. Target: 85%+.
