# Current Priorities

## P0: Full Autonomy (Founding Directive)

The system must be self-maintaining, self-improving, self-reporting, self-planning, self-correcting, and self-pruning.

## P1: Clarity

Remove unnecessary complexity. Keep only what's essential.

## P2: Automated Data Collection

Move COLLECT from manual to automated. Vercel cron or equivalent for 6-hour sync cycles.

## P3: Complete MP Profiles

Finish quote extraction for remaining 49/101 MPs to achieve full ANALYZE coverage.

## P4: Honest Accuracy

Always measure and report post-cutoff prediction accuracy. Current true accuracy: 73.3%. Target: 85%+.
