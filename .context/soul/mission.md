# Mission

**Autonomous intelligence suite for the Estonian Parliament.**

Riigikogu Radar collects parliamentary data, generates political intelligence, and produces actionable predictions — autonomously.

## Three Pillars

```
COLLECT → ANALYZE → PREDICT
```

1. **COLLECT** — Keep parliamentary data fresh and complete
2. **ANALYZE** — Generate intelligence from raw data
3. **PREDICT** — Forecast voting outcomes with validated accuracy

## What We Serve

## What We Never Do
