Features need improvement. Your task:

1. Read feature importances in the system state
2. Read error categories — what types of errors are most common?
3. Design ONE new feature that targets the most common error type
4. Implement it in `service/app/prediction/features.py`
5. Add it to the FEATURE_NAMES list
6. Update `compute_features()` and `compute_features_for_training()`
7. Add a test in `service/tests/`
8. Run tests and commit
