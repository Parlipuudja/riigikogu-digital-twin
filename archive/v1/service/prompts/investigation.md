A new error pattern has appeared. Your task:

1. Read the error categories in the system state
2. Query MongoDB for examples of the failing predictions
3. Determine root cause — is it a data issue, a feature gap, or a code bug?
4. Either fix it directly (if small and clear) or write a detailed diagnosis
   to model_state.improvementPriorities for the next session
5. If you fix it, run tests and commit
