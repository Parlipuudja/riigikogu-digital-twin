# Session Log: 2026-02-03

## Context
Continuing from previous session. Main issues were: simulation timeouts, Anthropic credits exhausted.

## Work Completed

### 1. Vote Simulation History System (carried from earlier)
- Created `StoredSimulation` type for permanent storage
- Added hash-based deduplication
- Updated drafts page to show cached simulations

### 2. Cost Optimization
- Switched predictions from Claude Sonnet to Claude Haiku 3 (12x cheaper)
- Reduced max_tokens from 1024 to 512
- Reduced RAG context (5→3 votes, 3→1 speech)
- Added individual prediction caching (7-day TTL)
- Added statistical bypass for high-loyalty MPs (>95%)
- **Estimated savings: ~90% per prediction**

### 3. Database Expansion
- Extended sync scripts to include 14th convocation (2019-2023)
- Created `fill-database.sh` for automated population
- Currently at 34.5% capacity (176 MB / 512 MB)
- Syncing: 3,748 votings (up from 1,912)
- Fill process running in background (rate-limited)

### 4. AI Provider Restoration
- User added Anthropic credits
- Verified Haiku model working on production
- Prediction caching confirmed working (~0.4s response time)

### 5. System Health
- All components healthy (database, Anthropic, Voyage)
- Production verified working at seosetu.ee
- 84% overall MVP progress score

## Issues Encountered

1. **Wrong Haiku model ID** - Fixed: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
2. **Rate limiting on Riigikogu API** - Using exponential backoff
3. **Embeddings at 51%** - Need to regenerate for new votings

## Decisions Made

1. Stay on Haiku for cost efficiency
2. Skip MongoDB upgrade (free tier sufficient)
3. Skip backtesting improvements for now (flawed)
4. Prioritize database fill to 80% capacity

## State at End of Session

- **Production**: Healthy, predictions working
- **AI**: Haiku active, ~$0.002 per prediction
- **Database**: 34.5% full, filling in background
- **Embeddings**: 51%, will regenerate after fill

## Background Processes

- `fill-database.sh` running: syncing 2020, 2019 votings + stenograms
- Rate-limited but progressing

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall MVP Progress | 84% |
| Active MPs | 101/101 |
| Votings | 3,748 |
| DB Capacity | 34.5% |
| Prediction Cost | ~$0.002/call |

## Next Steps

1. Monitor database fill completion
2. Regenerate embeddings for new votings
3. Verify full system functionality
4. Consider journalist outreach preparation

## Session 2: Brain Assessment & Upgrade (11:15 UTC)

### Context
User requested brain assessment. Found context system significantly out of date.

### Issues Discovered

1. **Background process crashed** — `fill-database.sh` stopped during embedding generation at 80/500
2. **Metrics stale** — Brain showed 3,748 votings, reality is 4,333
3. **Embeddings dropped** — From 51% to 46% (more votings added without embeddings)
4. **Database larger** — 263 MB (55%), not 176 MB (35%)
5. **2019 fill complete** — Brain showed "in progress"

### Brain Upgrade Applied

Updated:
- `state/health.json` — Added embeddings component, marked as degraded
- `state/blockers.json` — New critical blocker for crashed embeddings
- `action/priorities.md` — Accurate metrics, correct completion status

### Current Reality

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Votings | 3,748 | 4,333 |
| DB Size | 176 MB (35%) | 263 MB (55%) |
| Embeddings | 51% | 46% |
| 2019 Fill | In progress | Complete |
| Background | Running | Crashed |

### Next Action

Resume embedding generation:
```bash
npm run embeddings:generate
```

## Session 3: Worldview & Deployment (11:35 UTC)

### Work Completed

1. **Drafted worldview.md** — Comprehensive document covering:
   - Problem space (transparency paradox)
   - Stakeholders (journalists, citizens, researchers)
   - Estonian political context
   - Information gaps
   - Tensions (prediction vs influence, transparency vs privacy)
   - Threat model
   - Development implications

2. **Resumed embedding generation** — Running as background task b34ebad
   - Progress: 370/500 (74%)
   - Target: restore coverage from 46% to 80%+

3. **Investigated faction display issue** — User reported Tanel Kiik's faction wrong
   - Verified against official Riigikogu API
   - **Data is correct**: Kiik left Keskerakond on 2024-01-05, now independent
   - No bug - user may have expected former party

4. **Pushed to Github** — Commit f4518b8
   - Worldview document
   - Updated state files
   - Knowledge templates

### Deployment

- Pushed to `main` branch
- Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- Production: https://seosetu.ee

### Background Tasks

- Embedding generation: Task b34ebad, ~74% complete
- Monitor with: `tail -f /tmp/claude-1000/-home-ubuntu-riigikogu-radar/tasks/b34ebad.output`

### State at End

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Votings | 4,333 |
| Embeddings | ~50%+ (generating) |
| DB Size | 263 MB (55%) |
| Production | Deploying |
| Brain | Upgraded with worldview |
