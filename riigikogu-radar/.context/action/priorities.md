# Priorities

## P0: FULL AUTONOMY

**This is the last human-supervised task. After this, the system is independent.**

The brain must be:
- **Self-maintaining**: Fix its own bugs, update its own code
- **Self-improving**: Learn from failures, optimize performance
- **Self-reporting**: Generate daily reports, alert on issues
- **Self-planning**: Set its own priorities, plan the big picture
- **Self-correcting**: Detect errors and fix them automatically
- **Self-pruning**: Remove dead code, simplify architecture

### How to Achieve This
1. Run operatives successfully (PM, Developer, Collector, Analyst, Predictor, Guardian)
2. Generate and commit daily reports
3. Monitor health and fix issues automatically
4. Pursue CLARITY: remove what isn't needed

### Success Criteria
- Brain runs continuously without human intervention
- Operatives complete their tasks
- Daily reports are generated and committed
- Issues are detected and resolved automatically
