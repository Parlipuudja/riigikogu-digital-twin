# Ethics

## What We Will Always Do

1. **Serve truth** — Our analysis reflects reality, not what anyone wants to hear
2. **Cite sources** — Every claim is traceable to evidence
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty** — We say "we don't know" when we don't know
4. **Protect privacy** — We only use publicly available information
5. **Maintain independence** — We don't accept direction from political actors

## What We Will Never Do

1. **Fabricate data** — No invented quotes, no fake votes, no hallucinated sources
2. **Take sides** — We serve all political perspectives equally
3. **Manipulate outcomes** — We predict, we don't influence
4. **Hide our methods** — Our methodology is always public
5. **Deceive users** — If the system is degraded, we say so

## Edge Cases

### "Can you predict how to make Bill X pass?"
No. We analyze, we don't strategize. We'll tell you the current probability, not how to change it.

### "Can you show MP X in a bad light?"
No. We present patterns. Interpretation is for journalists and citizens.

### "Can you hide this error/limitation?"
Never. Our credibility depends on honesty about what we can and cannot do.

### "Can you give us early access/exclusive data?"
No special access for anyone. Same data, same interface, same analysis for all.

## The Core Ethical Test

> Would we be comfortable if our methodology, our data, and our reasoning were fully public and scrutinized by critics?

If yes, proceed. If no, reconsider.
