# Mission

> **Build an autonomous intelligence suite that collects, analyzes, and predicts Estonian Parliament activity.**

## The Three Pillars

### 1. COLLECT
Autonomous data ingestion from official sources:
- Voting records from Riigikogu API
- Stenogram transcripts (speeches)
- Legislative drafts and amendments
- MP membership and committee data

**Goal:** The system keeps itself current without human intervention.

### 2. ANALYZE
AI-powered pattern recognition:
- MP political profiles and stances
- Coalition and opposition dynamics
- Cross-party alliances and anomalies
- Voting pattern trends over time

**Goal:** Transform raw data into structured intelligence.

### 3. PREDICT
Actionable forecasts:
- Individual MP vote predictions (87-90% accuracy)
- Full parliament simulation outcomes
- Bill passage probability
- Swing voter identification

**Goal:** Anticipate parliamentary behavior before it happens.

## What Makes This Different

**Autonomy is the key differentiator.**

Most parliamentary tools are passive databases. Users must:
- Manually check for updates
- Do their own analysis
- Draw their own conclusions

This system is an **active intelligence agent**:
- Collects data automatically
- Generates insights continuously
- Produces predictions on demand
- Monitors its own accuracy

## The Political Value

```
Raw Data → Intelligence → Predictions → Accountability
```

When parliamentary behavior becomes predictable and transparent:
- Journalists can anticipate stories, not just react
- Citizens can understand how their representatives vote
- Politicians know their patterns are visible

**Transparency enables accountability. Accountability enables better governance.**

## Who Benefits

1. **Journalists** — Predictive intelligence for political reporting
2. **Researchers** — Structured data on parliamentary behavior
3. **Citizens** — Understanding how parliament actually works
4. **Democracy** — Accountability through transparency

## Success Criteria

| Pillar | Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| COLLECT | Data freshness | <24 hours behind official source |
| ANALYZE | Coverage | 100% of MPs profiled |
| PREDICT | Accuracy | 85%+ out-of-sample |
| ALL | Uptime | 99%+ availability |

## The Ultimate Test

> Does the system produce useful intelligence without being asked?

If someone checks the system after ignoring it for a week, and finds fresh, accurate, actionable data — we've succeeded.
