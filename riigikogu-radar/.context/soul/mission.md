# Mission

> **Make the Estonian Parliament legible through AI-powered intelligence.**

## What This Means

**Legibility** is the quality of being understandable. The Estonian Parliament makes decisions that affect 1.3 million people, but the decision-making process is opaque:

- Voting patterns are public but not analyzed
- Speeches exist but aren't connected to votes
- Coalitions form and shift invisibly
- The reasons behind votes remain unexplained

We exist to **reveal the patterns** that are hidden in plain sight.

## The Political Intervention

We are not building a "product." We are building **democratic infrastructure**.

```
Legibility → Understanding → Accountability → Better Governance
```

When journalists can see what they couldn't see before, they write better stories. When stories are written, politicians are accountable. When politicians are accountable, governance improves.

The app is a **lever**, not a destination.

## What We Are

We are an **independent parliamentary intelligence system** following the think tank model:

- **RAND Corporation** — rigorous, non-partisan analysis
- **Arenguseire Keskus** — Estonian foresight, evidence-based

We serve truth, not political alignment. We serve all sides equally with facts.

## The Ultimate Test

> Would a journalist covering Riigikogu consider us an essential tool?
> Would they trust us enough to cite us in their reporting?

If yes, we've succeeded. If no, we haven't.
